## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Controller Layer Design
**Rationale**: The specification requires REST API endpoints with multipart file upload support. Controllers must handle binary responses for files and JSON responses for metadata, following consistent patterns across all operations.

### Service Layer Architecture
**Rationale**: Complex PDF operations require separation of concerns with dedicated service classes for each functional area. This approach enables better testing, maintainability, and code reuse across similar operations.

### Resource Management Strategy
**Rationale**: Requirement 18 emphasizes efficient memory and resource management. Large file processing requires streaming approaches and automatic cleanup to prevent resource exhaustion.

### Concurrent Processing Design
**Rationale**: The system must support multiple simultaneous operations safely. Thread-safe design patterns and proper resource isolation are essential for production deployment.

### Integration Architecture
**Rationale**: The specification mentions integration with external tools (Python, LibreOffice, OCR engines). A flexible integration framework is needed to support various external dependencies while maintaining system stability.

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for all service layer operations with comprehensive edge case coverage
- Integration tests for API endpoints with multipart file upload scenarios
