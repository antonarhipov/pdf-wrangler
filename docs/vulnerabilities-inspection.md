# PDF Wrangler Security Vulnerability Assessment Report

**Assessment Date:** September 8, 2025  
**Application:** PDF Wrangler v0.0.1-SNAPSHOT  
**Technology Stack:** Spring Boot 3.5.5, Kotlin, Thymeleaf, PostgreSQL  
**Assessment Scope:** CWE-918, CWE-502, CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-287

## Executive Summary

This security assessment examined the PDF Wrangler application for five critical vulnerability categories. The application is currently in development with many features implemented as placeholder code. While this reduces immediate security risks, it presents significant vulnerabilities that must be addressed before production deployment.

### Key Findings:
- **HIGH RISK:** No authentication mechanisms implemented (CWE-287)
- **MEDIUM RISK:** Potential future SSRF vulnerabilities in planned external process integrations
- **LOW RISK:** Current XSS, SQL Injection, and Deserialization vulnerabilities due to proper implementation practices

## Detailed Vulnerability Assessment

### CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (Future Risk)  
**Current Status:** LOW RISK

#### Findings:
- **LibreOfficeIntegrationService**: Currently uses placeholder implementation but comments indicate planned external process execution via `soffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir /output/dir /input/file`
- **PythonWebpProcessor**: Currently uses placeholder implementation but comments indicate planned Python script execution via `python webp_converter.py --input input.jpg --output output.webp --quality 90`
- **OfficeDocumentConverter**: Uses placeholder implementations for document conversion
- **No HTTP Client Usage**: No RestTemplate, WebClient, HttpClient, or OkHttp usage found in current codebase

#### Potential Future Vulnerabilities:
1. **Command Injection via External Processes**: When placeholder implementations are replaced with actual external process execution, user-controlled input could be injected into command line arguments
2. **File Path Manipulation**: User-controlled file paths could potentially access unauthorized system resources

#### Recommendations:
1. Implement strict input validation and sanitization before external process execution
2. Use parameterized command execution instead of string concatenation
3. Implement file path traversal protection (PathTraversalProtection utility already exists)
4. Consider using containerized execution environments for external processes
5. Implement timeout and resource limits for external process execution

### CWE-502: Insecure Deserialization

**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Current Status:** SECURE

#### Findings:
- **Jackson Usage**: ObjectMapper instances found in `OperationContextLogger` and `SecurityAuditLogger` are used only for serialization (`writeValueAsString`) for logging purposes
- **No Deserialization**: No `readValue()`, `readTree()`, or other deserialization methods found
- **Controller Input Handling**: All controllers use `@ModelAttribute` for form data binding instead of `@RequestBody` for JSON deserialization
- **Validation**: Proper use of `@Valid` annotations for input validation

#### Recommendations:
1. Continue using form-based input handling where possible
2. If JSON deserialization is needed in the future, implement proper type validation
3. Consider using Jackson's `@JsonTypeInfo` with allowlist for polymorphic deserialization
4. Regularly update Jackson dependencies to latest secure versions

### CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Current Status:** SECURE

#### Findings:
- **Thymeleaf Templates**: All user data rendering uses proper escaping with `th:text` attributes
- **No Unsafe Rendering**: No `th:utext` (unescaped text) usage found in templates
- **Controller Safety**: WebUIController and other controllers handle UI routing safely without unsafe HTML rendering
- **Static Content**: Templates contain mostly static content with proper escaping for dynamic elements

#### Recommendations:
1. Continue using `th:text` for all user data rendering
2. Avoid `th:utext` unless absolutely necessary and with proper sanitization
3. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
4. Consider using OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer if rich text input is needed

### CWE-89: SQL Injection

**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Current Status:** MINIMAL RISK

#### Findings:
- **No Database Access Code**: No JPA repositories, entities, or JdbcTemplate usage found
- **Database Schema**: Well-designed Flyway migration with proper table structure and indexing
- **Security Audit Table**: Database schema includes security audit logging capabilities
- **Future Implementation**: Database functionality appears planned but not yet implemented

#### Recommendations:
1. When implementing database access, use JPA with parameterized queries
2. Avoid dynamic SQL construction with string concatenation
3. Implement proper input validation before database operations
4. Use the existing security audit table for logging database access attempts
5. Consider using database connection pooling with proper configuration

### CWE-287: Improper Authentication

**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Current Status:** CRITICAL VULNERABILITY

#### Findings:
- **No Authentication**: No Spring Security configuration found
- **No Authorization**: All endpoints are publicly accessible
- **No Session Management**: No session handling or user management implemented
- **Public API**: All PDF processing operations can be accessed without authentication

#### Current Vulnerabilities:
1. **Unrestricted Access**: Anyone can access all application functionality
2. **No Rate Limiting**: No protection against abuse or DoS attacks
3. **No Audit Trail**: No user tracking for operations (though audit infrastructure exists in database)
4. **Resource Abuse**: Unlimited file processing could lead to resource exhaustion

#### Recommendations:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Implement Spring Security with basic authentication
2. Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
3. Add rate limiting for file upload and processing operations
4. Implement session management with secure session configuration
5. Add user audit logging using existing security audit table
6. Consider implementing API key authentication for programmatic access
7. Implement CSRF protection for web forms

## Security Infrastructure Assessment

### Positive Security Measures Found:
1. **PathTraversalProtection**: Utility class exists for file path validation
2. **SecurityAuditLogger**: Service for security event logging
3. **MaliciousContentDetector**: Service for content validation
4. **FileValidationService**: Input validation capabilities
5. **SecureTempFileHandler**: Secure temporary file management
6. **Database Audit Schema**: Comprehensive security audit table structure

### Missing Security Measures:
1. Authentication and authorization framework
2. Rate limiting and throttling
3. Input sanitization for external process execution
4. Content Security Policy headers
5. HTTPS enforcement configuration
6. Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

## Risk Matrix

| Vulnerability | Current Risk | Future Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Priority |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| CWE-287 (Auth) | HIGH | HIGH | HIGH | HIGH | CRITICAL |
| CWE-918 (SSRF) | LOW | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| CWE-502 (Deser) | LOW | LOW | HIGH | LOW | LOW |
| CWE-79 (XSS) | LOW | LOW | MEDIUM | LOW | LOW |
| CWE-89 (SQLi) | LOW | LOW | HIGH | LOW | LOW |

## Remediation Timeline

### Phase 1 (Immediate - Week 1):
1. Implement basic Spring Security authentication
2. Add rate limiting for file operations
3. Implement CSRF protection

### Phase 2 (Short-term - Weeks 2-4):
1. Implement role-based access control
2. Add security headers and CSP
3. Implement user audit logging
4. Add input validation for future external process execution

### Phase 3 (Medium-term - Weeks 5-8):
1. Implement API key authentication
2. Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
3. Implement secure session management
4. Add automated security testing

## Conclusion

The PDF Wrangler application demonstrates good security practices in its current implementation, particularly in XSS prevention and input handling. However, the complete absence of authentication mechanisms presents a critical security vulnerability that must be addressed immediately before any production deployment.

The placeholder implementations for external process execution represent a significant future security risk that requires careful attention during development. The existing security infrastructure components provide a good foundation for implementing comprehensive security measures.

**Overall Security Rating:** MEDIUM RISK (due to development status)  
**Production Readiness:** NOT READY (authentication required)  
**Recommended Actions:** Implement authentication immediately, plan secure external process execution
