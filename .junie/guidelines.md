# Task List Management Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides technical instructions for working with the PDF Wrangler implementation task list located at `docs/tasks.md`. The task list contains 151 actionable technical tasks organized by implementation phases and system areas.

## Task List Structure

### Organization Hierarchy
- **Phase Level**: 4 implementation phases spanning 16 weeks
- **System Area Level**: Grouped by functional domains (e.g., Core Infrastructure, Security Framework)
- **Individual Tasks**: Numbered sequentially with checkbox placeholders [ ]

### Task Numbering Convention
Tasks are numbered sequentially, maintaining consistency across all phases and system areas. This allows for easy reference and tracking in project management tools.

## Working with the Task List

### Task Completion Workflow

1. **Task Selection**
   - Follow the phase-based sequence for logical dependency management
   - Within each phase, prioritize tasks based on system criticality
   - Consider inter-task dependencies before starting work

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Mark completed tasks by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
   - Use consistent checkbox format for automation compatibility
   - Update task status immediately upon completion

3. **Task Documentation**
   - Document implementation details in code comments
   - Reference task numbers in commit messages (e.g., "Task #23: Implement MergePdfController")
   - Link pull requests to specific task numbers for traceability

### Progress Monitoring

#### Tracking Mechanisms
1. **Automated Progress Calculation**
   ```bash
   # Count completed tasks
   grep -c "\[x\]" docs/tasks.md
   
   # Calculate completion percentage
   echo "scale=2; $(grep -c "\[x\]" docs/tasks.md) / 151 * 100" | bc
   ```
   
## Quality Assurance Guidelines

### Task Validation Criteria

1. **Functional Completeness**
   - All specified functionality implemented according to task description
   - Integration points with other components verified
   - Error handling and edge cases addressed

2. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Follows established coding conventions and patterns
   - Includes appropriate logging and monitoring
   - Maintains consistent architecture and design patterns

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests with appropriate coverage
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Performance tests for resource-intensive operations
